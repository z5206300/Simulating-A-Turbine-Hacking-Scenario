# Lego Design

Using these lego designs are optional for these simulations of the powerplant system. 

You can view either the "Low-Cost-Power-Plant.lxf" or the "High-Cost-Power-Plant.lxf" by first downloading the "LEGO Digital Designer" from the following link:

Buying the lego sets can be done using the designs in the files "Low-Cost-Power-Plant.lxf" or the "High-Cost-Power-Plant.lxf" through the official LEGO site:
